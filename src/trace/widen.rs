//! The boundary's widenings, applied INSIDE the traced frame.
//!
//! `Rt2::boundary_canonicalize` widens four things a moment after a
//! frame produces them: the player's `rem` becomes a constant interval,
//! the four timer globals are pinned to zero, the player's
//! `dash_effect_time` is clamped at zero, and a live fruit's `off`/`y`
//! become its whole bob band. The frame computes precise values for all
//! of them and the boundary throws them away.
//!
//! Doing it here instead means the GRAPH knows about the widening, and
//! that is the point (Philippe, 2026-08-23): "the graph should be
//! hashing the thing it is going to store in the future... we shouldn't
//! be storing something that might then get widened in a different way
//! later."
//!
//! What it buys is not saved arithmetic - only ~2.5% of the graph is
//! dead once these are erased, because `rem` still feeds `amount` which
//! still feeds the position. It buys CANONICAL ROWS, which is what lets
//! a kernel dedup its own output: two rows differing only in a `rem`
//! about to be erased compare equal here, and so do rows from different
//! lanes, which is the half a per-lane dedup cannot reach.
//!
//! ## The assertions come with it
//!
//! The boundary does not just widen, it CHECKS: `rem` was already inside
//! the interval, the fruit's `y` was already inside the band. Widening
//! earlier would silently retire those checks, because the boundary
//! would then be handed the widened value and pass trivially.
//!
//! So each one becomes an `ok` conjunct instead - a lane that violates
//! it is refused rather than quietly accepted, which under the
//! never-deopt doctrine stops the run and names itself.
