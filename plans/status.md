# Status (2026-08)

Branch `rewrite`. Build is warning-free, 171 tests pass, working tree clean.

## Measured, frame 34 (the standard iteration benchmark)

| program | time | memory |
|---|---|---|
| as compiled | 6.64 s | 1.75 GB |
| + `promote_cell` (130 cells) | 5.47 s | 1.12 GB |
| + slot plumbing (identity map, no-op) | 5.69 s | 1.12 GB |
| + `allocate_slots` | 4.65 s | 1.05 GB |
| + 183 `inline`s | 4.47 s | 1.12 GB |

Lane count is identical throughout (92,713), which is the first thing to check
when a rewrite claims a win. Frame 37 confirms the same ratios at ~13 s. Keep
routine runs at frame 34 or below; frame 40 takes over a minute.

Full numbers and the time breakdown are in `BENCHMARK_DATA.md`.

## Done

* **Stage 0** - the rewrite pipeline. `src/rewrite/`: program, recipe, rules
  (each with an independently-written verifier), dominance-aware validation,
  differential execution. `rewrite build | print | diff | check | verify |
  bisect | bench | suggest | slots`.
  30 frames of the real abstract search costs 1.7 s and covers 15,250 lanes, so
  every rewrite is differentially verified against an enormous number of
  concrete behaviours.
* **Stage 1** - `promote_cell`. 130 cells, converged in one round.
* **Stage 2** - `inline`. 183 call sites. See `plans/inline.md` for why it was
  parked for two months and what unparked it. 305 calls remain.
* **Slot allocation** - `LocalId` (logical, SSA) is separated from slot
  (physical, dense). `Cfg::slots` is part of the program; `slots::allocate`
  colours the conflict graph; `validate` re-checks it after every rewrite; and
  `LocalEnv`'s occupant array is the run-time backstop. 5207 slots over the
  program became 357, against a liveness floor of 346.
* **Profiling** - `rewrite bench --profile` gives a self-time breakdown.

## The measurement that should drive what comes next

Merging states back together **at the frame boundary is 60% of runtime**. The
frame itself is 39%, and `filter_split_flr` - the only semantically necessary
filtering - is 0.5%.

The cause is still intra-frame branching (`filter_branch` fires 830 times per
frame, so a frame ends as ~630 states), so the lever is to produce fewer states.
But it means **if-conversion should be judged by the state count arriving at the
frame boundary**, not by the `filter_branch` share, which slot allocation
already cut from 33% to 13%.

## Stage D landed, and it barely helped

`if_convert` works: 81 sites, `Select` in the IR and interpreter, an
independent verifier, `suggest if-convert` and `screen` to choose sites. Two of
84 candidates were dropped, for exactly the two predicted reasons - a select
that could not combine a bool with a number, and an arm that computed `-2 % 8`
on lanes that would have skipped it. Both were found by running, not by
analysis, which is the bargain the design makes.

    before   4.47 s   1.12 GB   576 mean fragments   28190 filter_branch
    after    4.59 s   1.06 GB   558 mean fragments   26886 filter_branch

81 conversions removed 4.6% of the splits.

## Why, and what to do instead

`rewrite bench --profile` now attributes each conditional branch to its source
block and says whether it split:

    branches: 21862 of 333379 executions split the state, across 33 distinct sites

**93% of branch executions are free.** All the fragmentation is in 33 places,
and `if_convert` was aimed at the wrong ones - `and`/`or` conditions are almost
always uniform across lanes. The full table is in BENCHMARK_DATA.md.

The top two sites are the same code twice: the `if` inside `btn()` in
`lua/builtin_level_4.lua`, inlined at two call sites. 2838 splits each, **zero**
uniform executions, 26% of all splits between them - and, because they duplicate
the state early in the frame, they multiply every split downstream.

That branch is the search's own branching factor. `__button_states[i]` starts as
an `UnknownBool`, and `flow.rs` sends a state branching on `UnknownBool` down
*both* edges unfiltered, so `btn` doubles the state count. No program rewrite
can remove it, because it is what enumerates the inputs.

But it does not have to be modelled as **state duplication**. The same
information fits in one state with twice as many lanes: `Bool(Vector([false; n]
++ [true; n]))` for the button, every other value repeated. Total lanes are
identical either way; the difference is the number of *states*, and every part
of the 60% merge cost is per state.

### Tried: make input fan-out expand lanes. It is worse.

`btn` was rewritten branch-free, with a `__concretize` builtin doubling the lane
space instead of an `if` splitting the state. Lane content came out
byte-identical over 25 frames (`rewrite observe`), and it was a clear
regression: 4.47 s / 1.12 GB became 5.46 s / 1.72 GB, with **the fragment count
unchanged at 576**.

The split simply moved into the caller. `if btn(k_jump) and ...` now branches on
a lane-varying bool and produces the same two states one branch later - except
that the old version had something going for it that this analysis missed:
duplicating the state leaves the button a **scalar** in each copy, so every
downstream condition derived from it is uniform and therefore free. Expanding
lanes makes it a vector, those conditions start splitting for real, and every
derived value becomes per-lane storage.

So `UnknownBool` branching to both edges is load-bearing. A fragment is a
scalar-specialised copy of the state, which is why 93% of branches are free.
Lane expansion only pays once the frame is already branch-free and there is no
downstream branch left to absorb the split - a late-stage change, not an early
one. Reverted; details in BENCHMARK_DATA.md.

## Where that leaves things

Three of the four ideas that looked promising from the profile have now been
measured and rejected: `Arc<Vec>` for gc (3%, not 20%), `if_convert` on the
`and`/`or` triangles (4.6% of splits), and lane expansion for input fan-out (a
regression). What each one taught is in BENCHMARK_DATA.md, and the pattern is
consistent: **fragmentation is not obviously wasteful.** Each fragment is a
state in which more values are scalar, and scalars are what make the
interpreter fast.

That reframes the target. The 60% spent merging is not the cost of a mistake
to be undone cheaply; it is the price of scalar specialisation, and it comes
down either by

  * making the merge itself cheaper - `merge_groups` 26%, `gc` 20%,
    `shape_grouping` 9%, `dedup_state` 9%, all charged per state on ~576 states
    per frame. Nothing here has been examined yet, and unlike the rewrites it
    does not depend on the program's shape.
  * or by getting all the way to a branch-free frame, at which point there is
    one state and no merge. That is stages D and E finished, not started: 305
    calls remain and no loop has been peeled. `if_convert` is built and works,
    but it cannot touch a branch whose arm calls or stores.

The second is the original plan and still the endgame. The first has never been
measured and is the obvious next thing to look at, since it is a bounded
question with a known cost.
